Active transcriptional regulatory elements are bidirectionally transcribed, the level of transcription correlating with regulatory activity. Using capped nascent RNA sequencing (PRO-cap) in 69 human lymphoblastoid cell lines, we previously identified over 80 thousand transcribed transcriptional regulatory elements (tTREs), both enhancers and promoters. Co-expression analyses, comparing tTRE expression across individuals, reveal interactions between tTREs. We find evidence of TFs influencing mid- to long-range interactions and of strand-dependent cooperativity at closely-spaced tTREs.
